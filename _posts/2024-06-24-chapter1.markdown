# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Welcome to the World of FIRST LEGO League

The FIRST LEGO League (FLL) is an exciting and dynamic international robotics competition that combines the fun of LEGO building with the rigor of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) principles. Founded by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers in 1998, FLL aims to inspire young minds to engage with STEM concepts in an interactive and hands-on way. Each year, teams of students aged 9 to 16 (9-14 in the USA) are presented with a new challenge that requires them to research real-world problems, devise innovative solutions, and build autonomous robots using LEGO Mindstorms technology to accomplish various tasks on a thematic playing field.

The program is more than just a competition; it's a community where students learn to collaborate, communicate, and develop critical thinking skills. Participants gain exposure to the engineering design process, programming, and problem-solving techniques that are essential in today's technology-driven world. Through FLL, students not only enhance their technical skills but also develop core values such as teamwork, gracious professionalism, and a sense of community.

In this book, we will explore the fundamentals of the FLL program, delve into the details of the competition, and provide insights into how coaches and mentors can effectively guide their teams to success. Whether you are new to FLL or a seasoned participant, this comprehensive guide will offer valuable information and inspiration to help you navigate the exciting world of FIRST LEGO League.


## My Journey as an FLL Coach

My journey as an FLL coach began serendipitously in 2017 when I volunteered as an FLL judge at the state championship held at Arizona State University (ASU). It was my former colleague and friend, Tom Situ, who first introduced me to this incredible competition. Little did I know that this experience would ignite a passion for STEM education and lead me on a transformative path.

Discovering FLL
As a judge at the ASU state championship, I was immediately captivated by the enthusiasm and creativity of the young participants. The competition was a vibrant showcase of innovation, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. Each team had worked tirelessly to design, build, and program their robots to complete a series of challenging missions. Beyond the technical aspects, I was deeply impressed by the core values of FLL, which emphasize collaboration, gracious professionalism, and community engagement.

Throughout the event, I had the opportunity to interact with students, coaches, and fellow judges, gaining valuable insights into the structure and objectives of the FLL program. The excitement and dedication of the participants were infectious, and I found myself inspired by their ingenuity and determination. By the end of the day, I was convinced that FLL was not just a competition but a powerful educational tool that could profoundly impact students' lives.

Taking the First Steps
Eager to share my newfound enthusiasm, I approached the principal of our community school in Arizona. I explained the concept of FLL, highlighting its potential to engage students in STEM learning through hands-on activities and real-world problem-solving. To my delight, she was incredibly supportive and encouraged me to start a course about the FLL competition and form a team right away.

With her backing, I set out to recruit students and gather the necessary resources. We began with a small group of eager learners, each excited about the prospect of building and programming robots. As we embarked on this journey together, we faced numerous challenges, from understanding the rules and guidelines of the competition to mastering the intricacies of LEGO Mindstorms. However, the students' enthusiasm and willingness to learn kept us motivated.

Building Our Team
Forming our first FLL team was both a challenging and rewarding experience. We started by introducing the students to the basics of robotics and programming, gradually progressing to more complex tasks as they gained confidence and skills. Our practice sessions were filled with trial and error, brainstorming, and collaborative problem-solving. Each setback was viewed as a learning opportunity, and each success, no matter how small, was celebrated with enthusiasm.

As a coach, my role was to guide and support the students, fostering an environment where they felt empowered to experiment and innovate. I encouraged them to think creatively, ask questions, and work together to overcome obstacles. Watching the students develop not only their technical abilities but also their confidence and teamwork skills was incredibly rewarding.

Competing and Growing
Our first competition was a nerve-wracking yet exhilarating experience. The students' hard work and dedication paid off as they navigated the challenges of the FLL playing field, presented their research projects, and demonstrated their core values. The sense of accomplishment and pride they felt was palpable, and it reinforced my belief in the importance of programs like FLL in fostering a love for STEM.

Over the years, our team continued to grow and evolve. We participated in multiple competitions, each time learning and improving from our experiences. The students' achievements extended beyond the competition; they developed a genuine passion for STEM, many of them pursuing further studies and careers in related fields.

Lessons Learned and Future Aspirations
Reflecting on my journey as an FLL coach, I have learned invaluable lessons about leadership, perseverance, and the transformative power of education. FLL has not only enriched the lives of my students but has also profoundly impacted my own perspective on teaching and mentorship. I have seen firsthand how STEM education can inspire and empower young minds, equipping them with the skills and confidence to tackle future challenges.

Moving forward, my goal is to continue advocating for STEM education through FLL and other similar programs. I hope to inspire more educators and parents to get involved, providing opportunities for more students to experience the excitement and fulfillment that comes with participating in FIRST LEGO League. Together, we can cultivate the next generation of innovators, problem-solvers, and leaders.

In this section, I have shared my personal journey from a curious volunteer to a dedicated FLL coach. My story is a testament to the impact of FLL and the importance of fostering a supportive and engaging learning environment for students. Whether you are a new coach or an experienced mentor, I hope my experiences provide inspiration and practical insights to help you on your own FLL journey.

## The Importance of STEM Education via FIRST Programs

STEM education is crucial in preparing the next generation for the demands of the 21st-century workforce. The rapid advancement of technology and the increasing reliance on automation and artificial intelligence mean that today's students need to be equipped with the skills and knowledge to thrive in a constantly evolving landscape. FIRST programs, including the LEGO League, play a vital role in promoting STEM education by providing students with engaging, hands-on learning experiences that foster a deep understanding of scientific and engineering concepts.

Research has shown that participation in STEM programs like FLL can significantly enhance students' academic performance, critical thinking abilities, and interest in pursuing STEM careers. These programs encourage creativity, innovation, and problem-solving, which are essential skills in any profession. Furthermore, they help to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, allowing students to see the real-world impact of their learning.

In this section, we will explore the broader impact of FIRST programs on STEM education. We will examine the benefits for students, educators, and the wider community, and discuss how these programs can help address the growing demand for skilled professionals in STEM fields. By highlighting success stories and case studies, we will demonstrate the transformative power of STEM education through FIRST programs and underscore the importance of investing in these initiatives for a brighter future.

Through these expanded topics, readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of the FLL program, the journey of an FLL coach, and the critical importance of STEM education. This foundation will set the stage for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the specifics of FLL competitions, team building, and technical skills development.
