## The FLL Challenge: Understanding the Components

The FIRST Lego League (FLL) Challenge is comprised of three main components: the Robot Game, the Project, and Core Values. Each component is designed to test and develop different skills, encouraging participants to think critically, work collaboratively, and innovate creatively.

## The Robot Game

The Robot Game is a key part of the FLL Challenge where teams design, build, and program an autonomous robot to complete a series of missions on a themed playing field. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Understanding the Field
- **Field Setup**: The playing field is a mat with specific mission models that need to be interacted with by the robot. Each year, the layout and missions change based on the theme.
- **Missions**: Missions are tasks that the robot must complete to score points. These can include moving objects, triggering mechanisms, or navigating obstacles.

### Robot Design and Build
- **Design**: Teams must brainstorm and sketch multiple designs before deciding on the final build. Consider factors like stability, maneuverability, and the ability to perform specific tasks.
- **Build**: Using LEGO Mindstorms or SPIKE Prime kits, teams construct their robot. The build process involves assembling motors, sensors, and structural components.

### Programming the Robot
- **Coding**: Teams use graphical programming environments like EV3 Classroom or SPIKE Prime App to write the code that controls the robot’s actions.
- **Testing and Iteration**: Extensive testing is crucial. Teams should test their robot’s performance in completing missions and iterate on their design and code based on the results.

### Strategy and Scoring
- **Strategizing**: Teams need to decide the order in which to complete missions and the path the robot will take. Efficiency and consistency are key.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded based on the successful completion of missions. Understanding the scoring rules and maximizing points through strategy is essential.

## The Project

The Innovation Project is where teams apply research and problem-solving skills to address a real-world issue related to the annual theme.

### Identifying a Problem
- **Theme Exploration**: Each year’s challenge has a theme (e.g., renewable energy, space exploration). Teams explore this theme to identify a specific problem they want to solve.
- **Research**: Conduct thorough research to understand the problem, existing solutions, and potential areas for innovation.

### Developing a Solution
- **Brainstorming**: Generate a range of possible solutions through brainstorming sessions. Encourage creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.
- **Prototyping**: Create prototypes or models of the proposed solution. This could involve sketches, physical models, or digital simulations.

### Presentation
- **Creating the Presentation**: Develop a compelling presentation that explains the problem, the research process, the proposed solution, and its potential impact.
- **Delivering the Presentation**: Teams must present their project to judges, effectively communicating their ideas and answering questions. Practice and polish the presentation for clarity and confidence.

## Core Values

Core Values are the cornerstone of FLL and emphasize teamwork, inclusion, and fun. They reflect how teams approach both the Robot Game and the Project.

### Discovery
- **Learning**: Embrace the process of learning and discovery. Value the journey over the end result.

### Innovation
- **Creativity**: Encourage innovative thinking and creative problem-solving. Look for new ways to tackle challenges.

### Impact
- **Contribution**: Understand the impact of your solutions and actions on the community and beyond.

### Inclusion
- **Teamwork**: Promote a culture of inclusion where every team member is valued and their contributions are recognized.

### Teamwork
- **Collaboration**: Work together effectively, leveraging each other’s strengths and supporting one another.

### Fun
- **Enjoyment**: Ensure that fun and enthusiasm are integral parts of the FLL experience.

By understanding the components of the FLL Challenge—the Robot Game, the Project, and Core Values—teams can approach the competition with a comprehensive strategy. Success in FLL is not just about winning; it’s about learning, growing, and having fun throughout the process.
